        details:'Erica Andrews current areas of interest are in the fields of Computer Science and Psychology. She\'s practiced these fields in her undergraduate education and for the past two and a half years. She is interested in combining both fields of her interest toward a position that allows her to practice and apply what she has learned. She has been a student for practically her whole life and drawn toward education and things related for as long as she can remember. She has explored many fields on its surface in order to discover whether the first educational field introduced would only capture her interest. However, being involved in a field related to mental health will allow her to apply what she has personally learned from her past, her experiences, and the past and experiences of others. This idea has drawn her toward assisting an organization in the field of health as much as she can in order to gain referrals and experience networking. Although her interests have guided her toward assisting many organizations in various fields, she assumes it will be an honor to contribute toward the field that initially captured her interest. She started practicing with computer programming languages about two and a half years ago by reading and writing code. After programming for a while, she began to take an interest in Web Development and Web Design. She began to create websites and eventually found her first internship as a Web Developer. She completed her first internship and eventually found another as a Web Designer. While interning, she practiced reading and writing programs and becoming better at understanding the various tools that can be applied toward creating a website. She learned a lot and is happy to know that she will always have more to learn in the technical field. She eventually discovered positions that have captured her current interest in order to apply both of her majors, Computer Science and Psychology. She hopes to explore these positions in the future as she continues to practice. She is not sure whether she will ever get the chance to benefit the health field by discovering or creating something unique. If so, she imagines it would be a wonderful experience. She has gone from studying the mental health field since a child, to exploring different types of fields out of curiosity, to diving into the technical field to see whether she may find assistance toward mastering her first field of interest. She has presently applied both fields to her activities and practices and hopes for the future to continue to learn.',
